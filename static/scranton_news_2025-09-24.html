It came after Jacksonville rallied for two runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to tie the game at 4.

                OLD FORGE — Riverside put the pressure on the Old Forge defense, but just couldn&amp;#8217;t break through for about 60 minutes. That changed quickly, thanks to Jose and Caleb Sosa and Nick Bohenek. Jose Sosa had a great run up the right side that led to a Caleb Sosa goal and Nick Bohenek blasted another shot into the back of the net a minute later to lift the Vikings to a 2-1 victory over the Blue Devils on Tuesday in a Lackawanna League Division III boys soccer game at Old Forge Veterans Memorial Stadium.

                One week after a change at the top of The Times-Tribune boys high school basketball poll, the girls ranking has a new No. 1 team. North Pocono, undefeated in its first four games, moved up two positions to No. 1. The Lady Trojans beat their opponents by an average of 32.3 points and allow 27 points per game. Riverside remained the No. 1 team in the boys poll after a 62-48 win over Wilkes-Barre Area. In the girls ranking, Scranton Prep fell only to No. 2 after suffering its first loss of the season to a talented Villa Maria Academy [&amp;#8230;]

                Looking back, Tony Battaglia probably wondered how long his basketball coaching tenure might last. After a 1-22 record in his first season and a 5-19 mark in Year 2, things were dicey. Battaglia, a former sharpshooter at Bishop O’Hara, stayed true to his beliefs.

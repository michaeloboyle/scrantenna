Home runs by Jose Rojas and Brennen Davis backed Winans and helped the RailRiders (77-50 overall) move to 39-16 in the International League second half and extend their first-place lead over Syracuse to five with 20 games remaining. Winans gave up three hits, did not walk a batter and fanned three. The RailRiders are 18-0 in games this season in which the righthander appears.

                SCRANTON — After falling behind in the first quarter, West Scranton used two big pass plays to seize momentum and begin to mount a comeback in the second quarter. However, Abington Heights used a fourth-down defensive stop to regain control. Nick Bradley and Gavin Anders took it from there. The duo connected for three touchdowns to help the No. 5-ranked Comets pull away to a 37-10 victory over the No. 10 Invaders on Friday night at Scranton Veterans Memorial Stadium. Bradley also had a rushing score, while Anders added six tackles, one forced fumble and one pass breakup on defense. [&amp;#8230;]

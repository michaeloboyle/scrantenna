                The Lakeland-Dunmore rivalry has intensified over the past quarter-century. In what is now an annual storyline, the teams are in contention for the Lackawanna Football Conference Division II and District 2 Class 2A championships. On Friday, the powerful programs meet for the 60th time. It is the opening game for both in their division schedules. Lakeland is 4-1 and Dunmore is 3-2 in nonleague games to the midway point of the season. “This means a lot to us,” Dunmore linebacker Brandon Mecca said. “We are very pumped up.

                Any hopes the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders had of winning the International League title Thursday night were dashed quickly. Jacksonville erupted for five runs in the bottom of the first inning and went on to a 7-4 victory in the deciding Game 3 of the final series at VyStar Ballpark in Florida. A ninth-inning comeback bid by the RailRiders made things interesting, but the early deficit proved too much to overcome and they were denied their third league championship in franchise history. Jacksonville claimed its second International League title — the other coming in 1968. The Jumbo Shrimp advance to Saturday night&amp;#8217;s [&amp;#8230;]

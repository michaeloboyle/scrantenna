                WILKES-BARRE TWP. — The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins are back to their winning ways. The locals scored two goals in the third period to break a 1-1 tie as the Penguins got back in the win column with a 3-2 victory over the Bridgeport Islanders on Friday night at Mohegan Arena. The victory comes after WBS sustained its first loss of the season Wednesday night to Providence. WBS remains on top of the Atlantic Division, two points ahead of Providence.

                CARBONDALE — Cold, blustery conditions usually aren’t conducive to a crisp passing game, but don’t tell Mid Valley’s Brett Yanoski that. Yanoski threw for 195 yards and three scores to lead the Spartans to a 35-0 victory over Carbondale Area to claim the Eastern Conference Class 3A Championship on Friday night at the Cerra Sports Complex. It was the first Eastern Conference championship in school history for Mid Valley (5-6).

                BY GARRETT CARR Sun-Gazette Correspondent Williamsport quarterback Tevin Williams took the shotgun snap, looked to his left and couldn’t find any daylight. He decided to reverse field and try to create something out of nothing while in the shadow of his own goal line. That’s when Williams’ sensational athleticism took over. He shook off two tackles, broke through the pile, extended his stride and was off to the races for a 96-yard touchdown run to put the Millionaires up by 20 en route to a 43-16 win in the District 2-4 Class 6A semifinals Friday. “On the snap, I read [&amp;#8230;]

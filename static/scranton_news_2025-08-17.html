                Fifty years have passed, but Jerry Dempsey remembers the play as if it happened yesterday. Game Two of an Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League doubleheader. Scranton Red Sox at Long Island Nationals. Score tied at 2 with two outs in the bottom of the seventh inning. Long Island with the winning run on second base. Dempsey on the mound for the Red Sox. A victory in the opener meant that Scranton could clinch the league title by winning the nightcap. If the Nationals won, it would keep their hopes alive of catching the first-place Red Sox. “A guy gets a base [&amp;#8230;]

                Cole Becchetti was thrown into the fire as a freshman. He responded. Carbondale Area fielded an experienced team with high expectations. Becchetti took the reins at quarterback, and as he improved and became acclimated to the speed and physicality of varsity football, the Chargers made a playoff push. In the second start of his career, Becchetti completed six of seven passes for 103 yards and a touchdown, and he ran for 85 yards and a touchdown, and Carbondale Area, fueled by its defense, posted a shutout win that got the team headed in the right direction.

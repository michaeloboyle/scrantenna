                After having its 11-game winning streak snapped Wednesday, the University of Scranton men&amp;#8217;s basketball team started another one Friday. But it wasn&amp;#8217;t easy. The Royals overcame a 13-point halftime deficit to defeat Goucher College in overtime, 74-71, in a Landmark Conference matchup in Towson, Maryland. Trailing, 41-28, Scranton slowly chipped away at the deficit and took a 60-59 lead on a basket by Sammy Tornabene with 5:33 left in the second half. Ben Robinson followed with a 3-pointer, but Goucher hit three free throws in the final 1:39 of regulation to force overtime tied at 62. Robinson and Jon Spatola [&amp;#8230;]

                COVINGTON TWP. — For three-plus quarters, with its defense stopping Scranton, North Pocono built a seemingly comfortable double-digit lead. But shots that weren&amp;#8217;t falling earlier for the Lady Knights started to drop and suddenly it became a one-point game. It took two Julia Biko foul shots with 11 seconds remaining for the Lady Trojans to finally secure a 39-36 win Friday night in a Lackawanna League Division I girls basketball game at North Pocono High School. Ella Clementoni scored 13 points to lead the way for North Pocono (7-1 league, 13-3 overall), which is ranked No. 1 in this week&amp;#8217;s [&amp;#8230;]

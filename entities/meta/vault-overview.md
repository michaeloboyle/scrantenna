## Vault Health

- **Total Entities**: `$= dv.pages().length`
- **Average Confidence**: `$= dv.pages().where(p => p.confidence).map(p => p.confidence).array().reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / dv.pages().where(p => p.confidence).length`
- **Total Relationships**: `$= dv.pages().where(p => p.relationships).map(p => p.relationships?.length || 0).array().reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)`

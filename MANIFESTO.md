# The Scrantenna Manifesto

## Our Mission

**Data-Driven Community Reporting**

Scrantenna is a news analysis platform that uses knowledge graphs and structured data to produce comprehensive, accurate reporting about Scranton and northeastern Pennsylvania. We transform the information ecosystem surrounding our community into clear, interconnected insights that inform better storytelling and deeper understanding.

## Why Knowledge Graphs Matter for Local News

Traditional reporting often treats news events as isolated incidents. Our approach recognizes that community stories are interconnected—that understanding one issue requires seeing how it connects to people, organizations, policies, and historical context that might not be immediately obvious.

By building knowledge graphs from news sources, social media, government communications, and community data, we can:

- **Track Story Evolution**: See how issues develop over time with complete historical context
- **Identify Hidden Connections**: Discover relationships between people, organizations, and events that traditional reporting might miss
- **Provide Comprehensive Context**: Every story we tell is backed by structured data showing the full network of relevant information
- **Ensure Factual Consistency**: Maintain accurate, up-to-date information about key community figures, organizations, and ongoing issues

## Our Coverage Philosophy

### Community-Centered Analysis
We focus on Scranton because we believe local communities deserve the same sophisticated analysis tools typically reserved for national politics or financial markets. Every neighborhood, every local election, every community development deserves rigorous, data-backed reporting.

### Temporal Integrity
We don't just report what's happening now—we show how current events connect to past decisions and future implications. Our knowledge graphs preserve institutional memory that might otherwise be lost.

### Relationship Mapping
We track not just what happened, but who was involved, how they're connected, and what roles they play in the broader community ecosystem. This helps readers understand the full context of local decisions and developments.

### Sentiment and Impact Analysis
Beyond just reporting facts, we analyze how the community responds to news, tracking sentiment and engagement to understand what stories truly matter to residents.

## Technical Foundation

### Multi-Source Data Integration
- Traditional local and regional news outlets
- Social media discussions and community forums  
- Government communications and public records
- Community event information and local business updates

### Entity Recognition and Tracking

### Quality Assurance

## Partnership Vision: WVIA Collaboration

We recognize the value of collaborating with established public service media organizations. WVIA's non-profit, non-partisan mission aligns with our commitment to factual, community-focused reporting. 

A potential partnership could provide:
- **Enhanced Coverage**: Our data analysis capabilities combined with WVIA's broadcasting reach
- **Public Service Integration**: Knowledge graphs supporting WVIA's educational and informational programming
- **Community Engagement**: Structured data helping WVIA better understand and serve their audience
- **Resource Sharing**: Collaborative fact-checking and story development processes

## Our Standards

### Accuracy Above All
Every piece of information in our knowledge graphs must meet journalistic standards for verification and sourcing. We build trust through transparency about our methods and reliability of our data.

### Non-Partisan Analysis
We focus on factual relationships and verifiable connections. Our sentiment analysis tracks community response, not editorial opinion.

### Community Accountability
We report to and for the Scranton community. Our success is measured by how well we help residents understand their local information landscape.

### Methodological Transparency
All our data processing, entity extraction, and analysis methods are documented and auditable. Community members should understand how we arrive at our conclusions.

## Our Commitment

Scrantenna exists to prove that local communities deserve sophisticated, data-driven journalism. We're building the infrastructure for deeper community understanding—not just reporting what happened, but helping residents understand how their community really works.

Every knowledge graph we build, every connection we identify, and every story we tell serves the goal of creating a more informed, engaged local democracy.
